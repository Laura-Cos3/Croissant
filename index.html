    <p>
      A croissant is a French Viennoiserie in a crescent shape made from a
      laminated yeast dough that sits between a bread and a puff pastry. It is a
      buttery, flaky, Viennoiserie inspired by the shape of the Austrian
      kipferl, but using the French yeast-leavened laminated dough. Croissants
      are named for the way that their dough rises when baked, taking their name
      from the present participle of the French verb "croître," meaning "to
      grow." The dough is layered with butter, rolled and folded several times
      in succession, then rolled into a thin sheet, in a technique called
      laminating. The process results in a layered, flaky texture, similar to a
      puff pastry.
